He brewed his interpretation using Valencia orange peel versus the traditional tart Curaçao orange peel, for a subtle sweetness. Then he added oats and wheat to create a smooth, creamy finish that’s inviting to the palate. As a final touch, he garnished the beer with an orange slice to heighten the citrus aroma and taste. Its natural unfiltered appearance adds to the depth of flavors in Belgian White*.\r\n \r\nAvailable in 12-oz. bottles, 6-pack, 12-pack, Brewmaster’s can, 16-oz. can, Draft", "dDXOEp_abv"=>"5.4", "dDXOEp_image_url"=>"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dDXOEp/upload_MOCbuS-large.png", "dDXOEp_brewery_name"=>"Blue Moon Brewing Company", "XIdmQT_name"=>"Blue Moon Grand Cru", "XIdmQT_id"=>"XIdmQT", "XIdmQT_description"=>"", "XIdmQT_abv"=>"8.2", "XIdmQT_image_url"=>"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/XIdmQT/upload_eI7oLw-large.png", "XIdmQT_brewery_name"=>"Blue Moon Brewing Company", "mYTqbC_name"=>"Blue Moon Vintage Blonde", "mYTqbC_id"=>"mYTqbC", "mYTqbC_description"=>"We never know what will inspire our brewmaster, Keith Villa, next. For our limited-edition Vintage Blonde, it just happened to be a grape from California and a 27-year after-work hobby.\r\n\r\nKeith has an obvious passion for brewing beer. That goes without saying. But he also has a little-known passion for wine-making. In 1995, while he was crushing grapes and thinking back to his travels through California and French wine country, the idea of blending a beer with a wine popped into his head. Intrigued, he had to give it a shot.\r\n\r\nHe started by using the juice of Chardonnay grapes to give the beer a crisp, light quality, very much like a glass of Chardonnay. He then used white wheat as the only grain to create a clean, smooth finish that could not be achieved with other malts. After cellar-aging the batch for a couple of months, he tasted his latest work. He was pleasantly surprised with the clarity and refreshing taste.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, with wine and Craft beer growing in popularity with drinkers, he decided it would be a good time to bring it back. After a couple of years at festivals and special events, it started to gain a following. Then in 2010, it just happened to take home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival®. Knowing an ale this good should be shared, we distributed it in 2011 as Vintage Blonde Ale™.
